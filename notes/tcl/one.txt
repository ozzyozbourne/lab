so the tcl we have default value for the function params and the function params are separated by
a space 

so a simple function can be 

proc one {a b c} {
}

with default value 
proc two {{a "one"} {b "two"} {c "three"}} {

}

so here this is we have the nested bracked since the s is defualt params with value {}
and it needs to be nested in the {} and that is nested in the function params declaration hence 
it looks

proc bp {{ s {} }} {

}

to access a variabel be use $varaible name and to declare it we just use a name 


ok so the difference in the starting the cluser
